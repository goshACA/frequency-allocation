## Frequency Allocation - Team Project

**The problem description:**<br>
In a GSM network every antenna can have multiple frequency channels, which can range from 1 to 6. Every Carrier frequency in GSM is 200khz. While assigning frequency channels to the antennas in the network, there are multiple factors that need to be considered in order to have an optimized solution. The major problem in this project that is being addressed is interference. **Considering the parameters that can create interference, the simulator assigns the frequencies to the antennas provided as inputs to the simulator.**

My Personal Tasks:
- Defining straightforward UI/UX
- Incapsulating chosen functionalites into classes
- Implementing CRUD operations 
- Implementing map interactions (Using Leaflet library)
- Publishing the project to npm
- Creating presentation based on the report
